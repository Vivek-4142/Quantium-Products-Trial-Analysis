# Quantium Chips Trial Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of the Quantium Retail Analytics Program.  
The objective is to evaluate the impact of a **trial chips layout** in selected stores and provide data-driven recommendations to the Category Manager.

We compared the performance of **trial stores (77, 86, 88)** with matched **control stores**, focusing on key retail metrics during the trial period (Febâ€“Apr 2019).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Select suitable **control stores** for each trial store using pre-trial performance similarity.
- Assess the **impact of the trial layout** on:
  - Total Sales Revenue  
  - Unique Customers  
  - Transactions per Customer
- Provide recommendations on whether the new layout should be rolled out.

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Converted dates to monthly periods.
   - Aggregated metrics: total sales, unique customers, and transactions per customer.

2. **Control Store Selection**
   - Used **Pearson correlation** to find stores with similar pre-trial performance.
   - Ensured fair comparison by matching each trial store to its most similar control.

3. **Trial Period Analysis**
   - Compared trial vs control stores during Febâ€“Apr 2019.
   - Analyzed whether changes were driven by new customers or increased purchase frequency.

4. **Visualization**
   - Created line plots for key metrics to clearly show trends.
